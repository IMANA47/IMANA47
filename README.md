I'm **Nsengimana**, also known as **Imana47**, a **Full Stack Developer** passionate about digital technology.

I love creating **simple, modern, and useful** solutions that have a real impact on people's lives.

I work in several fields: **web and mobile development**, **artificial intelligence**, **cybersecurity**, and **creative design**.

I enjoy learning, sharing, understanding, and improving what I do every day, with rigor and curiosity.

For me, **digital technology** is more than a job: it's a way **to simplify life, bring ideas to life**, and provide **solutions to problems here and elsewhere**.
