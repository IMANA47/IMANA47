Hi, I’m Nsengimana, a passionate **Full Stack Developer** driven by one mission —
using digital technology to make life simpler.

I started coding out of curiosity, but it quickly became a purpose:
to build useful, clean, and meaningful solutions that help people.
I love learning, building, and sharing everything I discover along the way.

Code with purpose. Build with impact
